# Summary

- [Cloud Computing and Vocabulary]()




## Cloud Computing and Vocabulary

### The main goals consist of describing terms such as: 

- High Availability
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Agility
- Fault Tolerance
- Disaster Recovery

### Cloud computing

Can be defined as a delivery model for services like storage (files, databases), computer power (virtual machines using windows or Linux and web services), networking (firewalls), analytics (performance, telemetry)

### Scalability 

Increase the size of a resource. 

Vertical scaling can be divided into two terms: 
- Scaling up: increase the memory, CPU, and storage
- Scaling down: decrease the memory, CPU, storage

Horizontal scaling, which increases the amount/quantity of the resources, can be divided into two terms: 
- Scaling out: increase the amount
- Scaling in: decrease the amount

In other terms

> Scalability is the ability to scale, adding or removing resources

### Elasticity

 The workload used during the day by the users where can be automatic scaling.

> Elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically

### Agility

The resources can be provided in two ways: manual or APIs and scripts. The main difference comparing cloud and on-premises environments is the time to finish. 

Cloud is faster than on-premises

</p>

The main definition is: 

> The ability to react quickly

### Fault ToleranceOne failure will not interrupt the service

> Disaster is a serious disruption of services caused by natural or human-induced causes.

Based on disaster, the term disaster recovery appears, using replication on multiple locals.

> Disaster recovery is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service.

### High availability 

Is a metric with measures the downtime of the services.

> Availability is a measure of system uptime for users/services and high availability is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with very little downtime.
